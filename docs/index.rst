Welcome to I2P Leaflet!
=======================

Leaflet is a Python library you can use to build applications that routes packets through the I2P anonymous network. Leaflet is a client of I2P's `Simple Anonymous Messaging v3.0 <https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3>`_ protocol.

Leaflet is based on ``i2p.socket`` but has a different level of abstraction and provides more Pythonic API. Leaflet is written in Python 3 and licensed under the MIT/Expat license.
